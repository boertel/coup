"After the November 3, 2020 US Presidential election, the campaign to re-elect Donald Trump has attempted to have Republican governors, federal and state courts invalidate and overturn election results in Pennsylvania, Nevada, Michigan, Arizona, Wisconsin, Georgia, and other states,[50] on a basis of discredited and disproven vote-fraud assertions.[51] President Trump has also spoken for more than eight weeks in-person at rallies, on social media, and on television - repeating false statments that he had ""won the election"" and claiming that Democrats were fraudulently ""trying to steal"" the Presidency.[52] As of January 6, 2021, he has refused to acknowledge the election loss.[53] The transition team of President-elect Joe Biden have claimed that Trump appointees have obstructed access to national-security information.[54] The President repeatedly attacked voting by mail earlier in 2020, and had appointed Louis DeJoy as Postmaster General, whose cuts to postal-worker hours and removal of collection boxes were characterized by many as an attempt to interfere with the 2020 election.[55] The Trump coup attempt has been supported by a number of Republican officials,[56] and their false claims have inspired violent street-protests by supporters including organized unofficial right-wing militias.[57][58][59] Numerous media organizations have discussed Trump's actions as a coup, including NPR,[60] The Washington Post,[61] the San Francisco Chronicle,[62] The New Yorker,[63] New Jersey Today,[64] Vanity Fair,[65] and many others.",2020,United States,
